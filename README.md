## General Informations

#### IoTApplication
This is an IoT Application to demonstrate IoT based solution

#### Business Case
Implementing a solution to sense body temperature of a patient and take necessary action. This solution can be useful in Healthcare Industry. With minor change this solution can be used in Environmental Industry also.

#### Business Solution to Problem
A Temperature Sensor will be attached with human body to sense body temperature on regular basis. After reaching a defined threshold value system will automatically generate and send alert to registered correspondence 



## Tech Informations

Here is the list of devices and editors to implement the solotion

* [ESP8266] - The ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip with full TCP/IP stack and microcontroller capability 
* [Raspberry Pi 3] - The Raspberry Pi 3 is a series of small single-board computers with microcontroller capability
